# EventBasedYearlyMean
Taking +/- 7 days from each Date in Table11.csv, each Date including the +/- 7 days is an Event for which we will compute a yearly Max/Min/Mean Wind Speed from a Period of Record Dataset for Multiple Gage Locations fom: https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=LA_ASOS

Each gage location has its own Period of Record of wind speed data. For each year in the period of record, over the time window of the Event's days/months, the Max/Min/Mean Wind Speed will be computed for eah gage.
